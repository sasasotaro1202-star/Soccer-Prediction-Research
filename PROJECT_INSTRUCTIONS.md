# PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS — Soccer-Prediction-Research

## Mission
Target-specific soccer prediction with fresh matchday snapshots and separate contracts for 1X2, Score Top1/Top3, O/U, BTTS and MOM Top1/Top4.
Optimize Future Generalization, case-level correctness, probabilistic quality, calibration, uncertainty, predictability awareness, robustness, PIT integrity, information value, selective prediction and operational reliability. Historical fit alone is not success.

## Every run
Re-check the latest GitHub HEAD/default branch, code/config, tests, workflows, Actions, artifacts, registries, production/champion/challenger state, current research/OOS/holdout evidence, failures and backlog. Prefer REUSE → REPAIR → INTEGRATE → TEST → VERIFY. Never rewrite past evidence to make the current state look consistent.

## PIT / time
Separate event/market time, prediction cutoff, source availability, publication, retrieval, effective time and revision time. Only use information demonstrably available by cutoff. Unknown/unverifiable availability is fail-closed for production-quality OOS.

## Evaluation
Use chronological walk-forward OOS/WFO. Random splits are prohibited for temporal prediction. Separate candidate selection from final OOS. Frozen holdout is final evidence only and may not be tuned.

## Data integrity
Missing ≠ zero. Preserve explicit unavailable/unknown/delayed/not-yet-public/source-failed/malformed/not-applicable states. Preserve source lineage, snapshots, schema, revision behavior and identity history.

## Models / routing
Maintain simple baselines. Add challengers only for demonstrated incremental OOS value plus robustness. Specialist routing requires sufficient sample/folds/class coverage where relevant, calibration evidence and recent stability; otherwise fallback to broader validated scope.

## Calibration / uncertainty
Calibrate chronologically. Confidence ≠ predictability. Track disagreement, OOD, data/source uncertainty, regime ambiguity and event/volatility/liquidity uncertainty when relevant. Permit FALLBACK/ABSTAIN/DEFER/WAIT/ACQUIRE_MORE/RECOMPUTE instead of forced prediction.

## Research / adoption
External methods must pass discovery, source verification, PIT/cost checks, local reproduction, chronological OOS, robustness and frozen holdout before adoption. A candidate is never promoted from a single fold or external claim.

## Reliability / cost / security
Use checkpoint/resume, idempotency, bounded retry/backoff, watchdog/heartbeat, stale-run detection, deterministic writes, artifact preservation, concurrency control, recovery and rollback. Never hide failure. Prefer verified free/OSS/local/cache; unknown-cost or billing-risk services are not automatic dependencies. Never expose credentials.

## Completion
Green CI, generated artifacts or a completed workflow do not prove performance verification or production completion. Evidence must cover tests, PIT/leakage/meta-leakage, relevant universe/scope audits, chronological OOS/WFO, calibration, ablation, robustness, frozen holdout, artifact integrity, reproducibility, recovery, release gate, monitoring and rollback.

## Status
Use IMPLEMENTED / EXECUTED / VERIFIED / PERFORMANCE_VERIFIED / PROMOTION_CANDIDATE / ADOPTED / PRODUCTION / STABLE / HOLD / REJECTED / FAILED / BLOCKED / DEFERRED / ROLLED_BACK / UNKNOWN / UNVERIFIABLE / SUPERSEDED / RETIRED distinctly.

## Loop
MONITOR → DETECT → TRIAGE → RESEARCH → IMPLEMENT → TEST → PIT → OOS/WFO → CALIBRATION → ROBUSTNESS → HOLDOUT → ADOPT/HOLD/REJECT → RELEASE → PRODUCTION → RECONCILE → FAILURE ANALYSIS → MEMORY → NEXT RESEARCH.


## Research runner handoff
Research execution must receive explicit TESTS_PASSED and AUDIT_PASSED boolean states. Missing/invalid handoff is BLOCKED. Retry only bounded transient failures; deterministic implementation/schema failures fail fast and remain non-OOS.

## Fallback routing contract
Research forecast coverage is total for structurally valid future fixtures. When adopted production models or specialist routes are unavailable, the router must use the PIT-safe fallback rather than returning an empty forecast. The fallback may use explicit historical result availability, versioned result-publication evidence, a weak Elo prior, and an explicitly PIT-verified current matchday market prior. Every fallback output must remain labeled RESEARCH_ONLY and expose data-support/uncertainty diagnostics. Production promotion requires the normal chronological OOS, calibration, robustness and frozen-holdout gates; fallback existence alone is never sufficient.
